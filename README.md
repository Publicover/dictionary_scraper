# Samuel Johnson's Dictionary Scraper

This is a quick Ruby program that uses nokogiri and mechanize to scrape the digital version of Samuel Johnson's Dictionary located at johnsonsdictionaryonline.com. All entries are saved to a folder in the root as plaintext. Testing is done through RSpec with the VCR gem to simulate HTTP connections.
