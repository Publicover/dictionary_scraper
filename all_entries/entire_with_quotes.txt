Glanville's Scepsis Scientifica, c. 16

[from bꞇan, Sax. signifying to enkindle or animate.] To push forward another, to support him in his designs by connivance, encouragement, or help.

Addison. Freeholder, № 50.

It is used with the particles from or to, but more properly with from. This I conceive to be an hypothesis, well worthy a rational belief; and yet is it so abhorrent from the vulgar, that they would as soon believe Anaxagoras, that snow is black, as him that should affirm it is not white; and if any should in effect assert, that the fire is not formally hot, it would be thought that the heat of his brain had fitted him for Anticyra, and that his head were so to madness. Glanville's Scepsis Scient. c. 17. Why then these foreign thoughts of state employments,Abhorrent to your function and your breeding?Poor droning truants of unpractis'd cells,Bred in the fellowship of beardless boys,What wonder is it if you know not men?

And a man may be accessory to the offence of another, after two sorts, by the common law, or by statute: and, by the common law, two ways also; that is, before or after the fact.  Before the fact; as, when one commandeth or adviseth another to commit a felony, and is not present at the execution thereof; for his presence makes him also a principal: wherefore there cannot be an accessory before the fact in manslaughter; because manslaughter is sudden and not prepensed.  Accessory after the fact, is, when one receiveth him, whom he knoweth to have committed felony.  Accessory by statute, is he that abets, counsels, or hides any man committing, or having committed an offence made felony by statute. Cowel.

To be added, as an advantage or improvement, in a sense inclining to good rather than ill; in which meaning it is more frequently used by later authors. From which compact there arising an obligation upon every one, so to convey his meaning, there accrues also a right to every one, by the same signs, to judge of the sense or meaning of the person so obliged to express himself. South's Sermons. Let the evidence of such a particular miracle be never so bright and clear, yet it is still but particular; and must therefore want that kind of force, that degree of influence, which accrues to a standing general proof, from its having been tried or approved, and consented to, by men of all ranks and capacities, of all tempers and interests, of all ages and nations. Atterbury's Sermons.  To append to, or arise from; as, an ill consequence; this sense seems to be less proper. His scholar Aristotle, as in many other particulars, so likewise in this, did justly oppose him, and became one of the authors; choosing a certain benefit, before the hazard that might accrue from the disrespects of ignorant persons. Wilk. Math. Mag.  In a commercial sense, to be produced, or arise; as, profits. The yearly benefit, that, out of those his works, accrueth to her majesty, amounteth to one thousand pounds. Carew's Surv. The great profits which have accrued to the duke of Florence from his free port, have set several of the states of Italy on the same subject. Addison on Italy.

One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,For quick accumulation of renown,Which he atchiev'd by th' minute, lost his favour. Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra.  The state of being accumulated. By the regular returns of it in some people, and their freedom from it after the morbid matter is exhausted, it looks as there were regular accumulations and gatherings of it, as of other humours in the body, growing perhaps on some people as corns.

Dryd. Fab. Achievement, in the first sense, is derived from achive, as it signifies to perform; in the second, from achieve, as it imports to gain.

Neither a bare approbation of, nor a mere wishing, nor unactive complacency in; nor, lastly, a natural inclination to things virtuous and good, can pass before God for a man's willing of such things; and, consequently, if men, upon this account, will needs take up and acquiesce in an airy ungrounded persuasion, that they will those things which really they not will, they fall thereby into a gross and fatal delusion. South. He hath employed his transcendent wisdom and power, that by these he might make way for his benignity, as the end wherein they ultimately acquiesce. Grew's Cosmolog. Sac. b. i.

[from acquiesce.]   A silent appearance of consent, distinguished on one side from avowed consent, on the other from opposition.

Those rational instincts, the connate principles engraven in the human soul, though they are truths acquirable and deducible by rational consequence and argumentation, yet they seem to be inscribed in the very crasis and texture of the soul, antecedent to any acquisition by industry or the exercise of the discursive faculty in man. Hales's Origin of Mankind. If the powers of cogitation and volition, and sensation, are neither inherent in matter as such, nor acquirable to matter by any motion or modification of it; it necessarily follows, that they proceed from some cogitative substance, some incorporeal inhabitant within us, which we call spirit and soul. Bentley.

Locke.

South's Sermons. The thing gained; acquirement.                      Great Sir, all acquisition Of glory as of empire, here I lay before Your royal feet. Denham's Sophy. A state can never arrive to its period in a more deplorable crisis, than when some prince lies hovering like a vulture to dismember its dying carcase; by which means it becomes only an acquisition to some mighty monarchy, without hopes of a resurrection. Swift on the Dissensions in Athens and Rome.

Steady to my principles, and not dispirited with my afflictions, I have, by the blessing of God on my endeavours, overcome all difficulties; and, in some measure, acquitted myself of the debt which I owed the publick, when I undertook this work.

Actions are personal, real , and mixt: action personal belongs to a man against another, by reason of any contract, offence, or cause, of like force with a contract or offence made or done by him or some other, for whose fact he is to answer. Action real is given to any man against another, that possesses the thing required or sued for in his own name, and no other man's. Action mixt is that which lies as well against or for the thing which we seek, as against the person that hath it; called mixt, because it hath a mixt respect both to the thing and to the person.  Action is divided into civil, penal, and mixt. Action civil is that which tends only to the recovery of that which is due to us; as, a sum of money formerly lent. Action penal is that which aims at some penalty or punishment in the party sued, be it corporal or pecuniary: as, in common law, the next friends of a man feloniously slain shall pursue the law against the murderer. Action mixt is that which seeks both the thing whereof we are deprived, and a penalty also for the unjust detaining of the same.  Action upon the case, is an action given for redress of wrongs done without force against any man, by law not specially provided for.

Newton's Opticks.  That which acts, opposed to passive, or that which suffers.  — When an even flame two hearts did touch, His office was indulgently to fit Actives to passives, correspondency Only his subject was.

An eternal sterility must have possessed the world, where all things had been fixed and fastened everlastingly with the adamantine chains of speciﬁc gravity; if the Almighty had not spoken and said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit after its kind; and it was so. Bentley's Sermons. In adamantine chains shall death be bound, And hell's grim tyrant feel th' eternal wound. Pope's Messiah.

Brown's Vulgar Errours, b. iii. c. ii. Their adhesion may be in part ascribed, either to some elastical motion in the pressed glass, or to the exquisite adaptation of the almost numberless, though very small, asperities of the one, and the numerous little cavities of the other; whereby the surfaces do lock in with one another, or are, as it were, clasped together.

[from after and game.] The scheme which may be laid, or the expedients which are practised after the original design has miscarried; methods taken after the first turn of affairs.

The fables of the ax-handle and the wedge, serve to precaution us not to put ourselves needlessly upon an aftergame, but to weigh beforehand what we say and do. L'Estrange's Fab.

The poor remnant of human seed, which remained in their mountains, peopled their country again slowly, by little and little. Bacon's New Atalantis.  Go now, deluded man, and seek again New toils, new dangers, on the dusty plain. Dryd. Æn.  Some are already retired into foreign countries; and the rest, who possess lands, are determined never to hazard them again, for the sake of establishing their superstition. Swift.  On the other hand; marking some opposition or contrariety.  His wit encreased upon the occasion; and so much the more, if the occasion were sharpened with danger. Again, whether it were the shortness of his foresight, or the strength of his will, certain it is, that the perpetual trouble of his fortunes could not have been without defects in his nature. Bacon.  Those things that we know not what do  withal, if we had them, and those things, again, which another cannot part with, but to his own loss and share, are the very conditions of this fable. L'Estrange's Fables.  On another part; marking a transition to some new consideration.  Behold, yon mountain's hoary height, Made higher with new mounts of snow; Again, behold the winter's weight Oppress the labr'ing woods below. Dryden.  In return, noting re-action, or reciprocal action; as, his fortune worked upon his nature, and his nature again upon his fortune.   Back, in restitution.                   When your head did but ake, I knit my handkerchief upon your brows; The best I had, a princess wrought it me, And I did never ask it you again. Shakesp. King John.  In return for any thing; in recompense.  That he hath given will he pay again. Prov. xix. 27.  In order of rank or succession; marking distribution.  Question was asked of Demosthenes, What was the chief part of an orator?  He answered, Action.  What next?  Action.  What next, again? Action. Bacon's Essays.  The  cause of the holding green, is the close and compact substance of their leave, and the pedicles of them: and the cause of that again is either the tough and vicious juice of the plant, or the strength and heat thereof. Bacon's Natural History.  Besides; in any other time or place.  They have the Walloons, who are tall soldiers; yet that is but a spot of ground.  But, on the other side, there is not in the world again such a spring and seminary of brave military people, as in England, Scotland, and Ireland. Bacon.  Twice as much; marking the same quantity once repeated.  There are whom heav'n has blest with store of wit, Yet want as much again to manage it; For wit and judgment ever are at strife, Tho' meant each other's aid, like man and wife. Pope.  I should not be sorry to see a chorus on a theatre, more than as large and as deep again as ours, built and adorned at a king's charges. Dryden's Dufresnoy.  Again and again; with frequent repetition; often.  This is not to be obtained by one or two hasty readings; it must be repeated again and again, with a close attention to the tenour of the discourse. Locke's Essay on St. P. Epistles.  In opposition, by way of resistance.  Who art thou that answerest again? Rom. ix. 20.  Back; as returning from some message.  Bring us word again which way we shall go. Deut. i. 22.

And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him. Gen. xvi. 12.  Contrary; opposite, in general.  That authority of men should prevail with men either against or above reason, is no part of our belief. Hooker.  He is melancholy without cause, and merry against the hair. Shakesp. Troilus and Cressida.  We might work any effect without and against matter; and this not holpen by the co-operation of angels or spirits, but only by the unity and harmony of nature. Bacon's Natural Hist.  The preventing goodness of God does even wrest him from himself, and save him, as it were, against his will. South.  The god, uneasy till he slept again, Resolv'd, at once, to rid himself of pain; And, tho' against his custom, call'd aloud, Exciting Morpheus, from the sleepy crowd. Dryden.  Men often say a thing is against their conscience, when really it is not. Swift's Miscellanies.  In contradiction to any opinion.  After all that can be said against a thing, this will still be true, that many things possibly are, which we know not of; and that many more things may be than are: and if so, after all our arguments against a thing, it will be uncertain whether it be or not. Tillotson.  The church-clergy have written the best collection of tracts against popery, that ever appeared in England. Swift.  With contrary motion or tendency; used of material action.                               Boils and plagues Plaister you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd Farther than seen, and one infect another Against the wind a mile. Shakesp. Coriolanus.  The kite being a bird of prey, and therefore hot, delighteth in the fresh air; and many times flieth against the wind, as trouts and salmons swim against the stream. Bacon.  Contrary to rule or law.                   If aught against my life Thy country sought of thee, it sought unjustly, Against the law of nature, law of nations. M. Sam. Agon.  Against the public sanctions of the peace, Against all omens of their ill success; With fates averse, the rout in arms resort,To force their monarch, and insult the court. Dryden's Æn.  Opposite to, in place.  Against the Tiber's mouth, but far away. Dryden.  To the hurt of another. And when thou think'st of her eternity, Think not that death against her nature is; Think it a birth: and when thou go'st to die, Sing like a swan, as if thou went'st to bliss. Sir J. Davies.  In provision for; in expectation of.  This mode of speaking probably had its original from the idea of making provision against, or in opposition to a time of misfortune, but by degrees acquired a neutral sense.  Thence she them brought into a stately hall, Wherein were many tables fair dispred, And ready dight with drapets festival, Against the viands should be ministred. Fairy Queen.  The like charge was given them against the time they should come to settle themselves in the land promised unto their fathers. Hooker, b. v. § 11.  Some say, that ever 'gainst that season comes, Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night long: And then they say no spirit walks abroad; The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike, No fairy tales, no witch hath power to charm; So hallowed and so gracious is the time. Shakesp. Hamlet.  To that purpose, he made haste to Bristol, that all things might be ready against the prince came thither. Clarendon. Against the promis'd time provides with care, And hastens in the woof, the robes he was to wear. Dryd.  And which I grant to be reasonably and truly said, and only desire they may be remembered against another day. Stillingfl.

[from a and gape.] Staring with eagerness; as, a bird gapes for meat.                  In himself was all his state; More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits On princes, when their rich retinue long Of horses led, and grooms besmear'd with gold, Dazzles the crowd, and sets them all agape. Paradise Lost. Dazzle the crowd, and set them all agape. Philips. The whole crowd stood agape, and ready to take the doctor at his word. Spectator, № 572.

It is divided into male and female; the male is used only in dying, the female in medicine: the male grows on oaks, the female on larches.

Bacon.

[This word, which is usually, by later authors, written aghast, is, not improbably, the true word derived from agaze, which has been written aghast, from a mistaken etymology. See Aghast.] Struck with terrour; amazed; frighted to astonishment.                          Thus roving on In confus'd march forlorn, th' advent'rous bands, With shudd'ring horrour pale, and eyes agast, View'd first their lamentable lot, and found No rest. Milton's Paradise Lost, b. ii. l. 616.

If the comparison do stand between man and man, which shall hearken unto other, sith the aged, for the most part, are best experienced, least subject to rash and unadvised passions. Hooker, b. v. § 7.  Novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking. Shakesp. Measure for Measure.  Kindness itself too weak a charm will prove, To raise the feeble fires of aged love. Prior.  Old; applied to inanimate things. This use is rare, and commonly with some tendency to the prosopopœia.  The people did not more worship the images of gold and ivory, than they did the groves; and the same Quintilian saith of the aged oaks. Stillingfleet's Defence of Disc. on Rom. Idol.

This success is oft truly ascribed unto the force of imagination upon the body agent; and then, by a secondary means, it may upon a diverse body; as, for example, if a man carry a ring, or some part of a beast, believing strongly that it will help him to obtain his love, it may make him more industrious, and again more confident and persisting than otherwise he would be. Bacon's Natural History, № 902.

Where there is no doubt, deliberation is not excluded as impertinent unto the thing, but as needless in regard of the agent, which seeth already what to resolve upon. Hooker.  To whom nor agent, from the instrument, Nor pow'r of working, from the work is known. Davies.  Heav'n made us agents free to good or ill, And forc'd it not, tho' he foresaw the will. Freedom was first bestow'd on human race, And prescience only held the second place. Dryden.  A miracle is a work exceeding the power of any created agent, consequently being an effect of the divine omnipotence. South's Sermons  A substitute; a deputy; a factor; a person employed to transact the business of another.  — All hearts in love, use your own tongues; Let every eye negotiate for itself, And trust no agent. Shakespeare.  They had not the wit to send to them, in any orderly fashion, agents or chosen men, to tempt them, and to treat with them. Bacon's Henry VII.  Remember, Sir, your fury of a wife, Who, not content to be reveng'd on you, The agents of your passion will pursue. Dryden's Aureng.

If I were to tell what I mean by the word air, I may say, it is that fine matter which we breathe in and breathe out continually; or it is that thin fluid body, in which the birds fly, a little above the earth; or it is that invisible matter, which fills all places near the earth, or which immediately encompasses the globe of earth and water. Watt's Logick.  The state of the air; or the air considered with regard to health. There be many good and healthful airs, that do appear by habitation and other proofs, that differ not in smell from other airs. Bacon's Natural History, № 904.  Air in motion; a small gentle wind.             Fresh gales, and gentle airs,Whisper'd it to the woods, and from their wingsFlung rose, flung odours from the spicy shrubDisporting! Milton's Paradise Lost, b. viii. l. 515. But safe repose, without an air of breath,Dwells here, and a dumb quiet next to death. Dryden. Let vernal airs through trembling osiers play,And Albion's cliffs resound the rural lay. Pope's Pastorals.  Blast.

A man born out of the land, so it be within the limits beyond the seas, or of English parents out of the king's obedience, so the parents, at the time of the birth, be of the king's obedience, is not alien.  If one born out of the king's allegiance, come and dwell in England, his children (if he beget any here) are not aliens, but denizens. Cowell.

Locke.

It is written differently, as it is supposed to come from the French or Spanish language; and the original derivation being uncertain, it is not easy to settle its orthography. Some derive it from the Hebrew בשר, to tell, and םבשר, a messenger; others from ambactus, which, in the old Gaulish, signified a servant; whence ambascia, in low Latin, is found to signify service, and ambasciator, a servant; others deduce it from ambacht, in old Teutonick, signifying a government, and Junius mentions a possibility of its descent from αναβαινω; and others from am for ad, and bassus, low, as supposing the act of sending an ambassadour, to be in some sort an act of submission. All these derivations lead to write ambassadour, not embassadour.] A person sent in a publick manner from one sovereign power to another, and supposed to represent the power from which he is sent. The person of an ambassadour is inviolable. Ambassador is, in popular language, the general name of a messenger from a sovereign power, and sometimes, ludicrously, from common persons. In the juridical and formal language, it signifies particularly a minister of the highest rank residing in another country, and is distinguished from an envoy, who is of less dignity.  Give first admittance to th' ambassadours. Shak. Hamlet.  Rais'd by these hopes, I sent no news before, Nor ask'd you leave, nor did your faith implore; But come, without a pledge, my own ambassadour. Dryden.

The desire of any thing great or excellent. The quick'ning power would be, and so would rest;The sense would not be only, but be well:But wit's ambition longeth to the best,For it desires in endless bliss to dwell. Sir J. Davies.         Urge them, while their soulsAre capable of this ambition;Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breathOf soft petitions, pity and remorse,Cool and congeal again to what it was. Shakesp. K. John.  It is used with to before a verb, and of before a noun. I had a very early ambition to recommend my self to your Lordship's patronage. Addison. There was an ambition of wit, and an affectation of gayety. Pope's Preface to his Letters.

Locke.  Any, or some; as, an elephant might swim in this water.  He was no way at an uncertainty, nor ever in the least at a loss concerning any branch of it. Locke on St. Paul's Epistles.  A wit's a feather, and a chief a rod, An honest man's the noblest work of God. Pope.  Sometimes it signifies, like a, some particular state; but this is now disused.  It is certain, that odours do, in a small degree, nourish; especially the odour of wine; and we see men an hungred do love to smell hot bread. Bacon's Natural History.  An is sometimes, in old authors, a contraction of and if.          He can't flatter, he! An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth; An they will take it so; if not, he's plain. Shakesp. K. Lear.  Sometimes a contraction of and before if.                        Well I know The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it. ——— He will an' if he live to be a man. Shakesp. Merchant of Venice.  Sometimes it is a contraction of as if.  My next pretty correspondent, like Shakespeare's lion in Pyramus and Thisbe, roars an' it were any nightingale. Addison. Guardian, № 121.

[animal, Lat.]   A living creature corporeal, distinct, on the one side, from pure spirit, on the other side, from mere matter. Animals are such beings, which, besides the power of growing, and producing their like, as plants and vegetables have, are endowed also with sensation and spontaneous motion. Mr. Ray gives two schemes of tables of them.   Animals are either    Sanguineous, that is, such as have blood, which breathe either by    Lungs, having either    Two ventricles in their heart, and those either    Veviparious,    Aquatick, as the whale kind,   Terrestrial, as quadrupeds;   Oviparous, as birds.   But one ventricle in the heart, as frogs, tortoises, and serpents.   Gills, as all sanguineous fishes, except the whale kind.   Exsanguineous, or without blood, which may be divided into    Greater, and those either,    Naked,    Terrestrial, as naked snails.   Aquatick, as the poulp, cuttle-fish, &c.   Covered with a tegument, either      Crustaceous, as lobsters and crab-fish.   Testaceous, either        Univalve, as limpets;   Bivalve, as oysters, muscles, cockles;   Turbinate, as periwinkles, snails, &c.   Lesser, as insects of all sorts.   Viviparous hairy animals, or quadrupeds, are either    Hoofed, which are either    Whole-footed or hoofed, as the horse and ass;   Cloven-footed, having the hoof divided into   Two principal parts, called bisulca, either    Such as chew not the cud, as swine;   Ruminant, or such as chew the cud; divided into    Such as have perpetual and hollow horns.    Beef-kind,   Sheep-kind   Goat-kind.   Such as have solid, branched and deciduous horns, as the deer-kind.   Four parts, or quadrisulca, as the rhinoceros and hippopotamus.   Clawed or digitate, having the foot divided into      Two parts or toes, having two nails, as the camel kind;   Many toes or claws; either        Undivided, as the elephant;   Divided, which have either          Broad nails, and an human shape, as apes;   Narrower, and more pointed nails,   which, in respect of their teeth, are divided into such as have    Many fore-teeth, or cutters in each jaw;    The greater, which have    A shorter snout and rounder head, as the cat-kind;   A longer snout and head, as the dog-kind.   The lesser, the vermin or weazel kind.   Only two large and remarkable fore-teeth, all which are phytivorous, and are called the hare kind. Ray. Vegetables are proper enough to repair animals, as being near of the same specifick gravity with the animal juice, and as consisting of the same parts with animal substances, spirit, water, salt, oil, earth; all which are contained in the sap they derive from the earth. Arbuthnot on Aliments.  Some of the animated substances have various organical or instrumental parts, fitted for a variety of motions from place to place, and a spring of life within themselves, as beasts, birds, fishes, and insects; these are called animals. Other animated substances are called vegetables, which have within themselves the principles of another sort of life and growth, and of various productions of leaves and fruit, such as we see in plants, herbs, and trees. Watts's Logick.  By way of contempt, we say of a stupid man, that he is a stupid animal.

A man shall have diffused his life, his self, and his whole concernments so far, that he can weep his sorrows with another's eyes; when he has another heart besides his own, both to share, and to support his grief.

[attenter, Fr.]   To attaint is particularly used for such as are found guilty of some crime or offence, and especially of felony or treason.  A man is attainted two ways, by appearance, or by process.  Attainder by appearance is by confession, battle, or verdict.  Confession is double; one at the bar before the judges, when the prisoner, upon his indictment read, being asked guilty or not guilty, answers guilty, never putting himself upon the verdict of the jury.  The other is before the coroner in sanctuary, where he, upon his confession, was in former times constrained to abjure the realm; which kind is called attainder by abjuration.  Attainder by battle is, when the party appealed, and choosing to try the truth by combat rather than by jury, is vanquished.  Attainder by verdict is, when the prisoner at the bar, answering to the indictment not guilty, hath an inquest of life and death passing upon him, and is by the verdict pronounced guilty.  Attainder by process is, where a party flies, and is not found till five times called publickly in the county, and at last outlawed upon his default. Cowel.

1071|Barometer|2018-02-08 22:35:02 -0500|2018-02-08 22:35:02 -0500|Baro'meter. n.s. [from βάρος, weight, and μἐτρον, measure.]  A machine for measuring the weight of the atmosphere, and the variations in it, in order chiefly to determine the changes of the weather. It differs from the baroscope, which only shews that the air is heavier at one time than another, without specifying the difference. The barometer is founded upon the Torricellian experiment, so called from Torricelli the inventor of it, at Florence, in 1643; which is a glass tube filled with mercury, horizontally sealed at one end; the other open and immerged in a bason of stagnant mercury; so that, as the weight of the atmosphere diminishes, the mercury in the tube will descend, and, as it encreases, the mercury will ascend; the column of mercury suspended in the tube, being always equal to the weight of the incumbent atmosphere. Many attempts have been made to render the changes in the barometer more sensible, in order to measure the atmosphere more accurately; and hence arose a great number of barometers, of different structures. Dr. Halley observes, in the Philosophical Transactions, that in calm weather, when the air is inclined to rain, the mercury is commonly low; in serene good settled weather, high. On great winds, though unaccompanied with rain, the mercury is lowest of all, with regard to the point of the compass the wind blows on. The greatest heights of the mercury are on easterly and north-easterly winds, cæteris paribus. After great storms of wind, when the mercury has been low, it rises again very fast. In calm frosty weather, it stands high. The more northerly places find greater alterations than the more southern; and within the tropicks, and near them, there is little or no variation of the height of the mercury. The rising of the mercury forebodes fair weather after foul, and an easterly or north-easterly wind; its falling portends southerly or westerly winds, or both.  In a storm, the mercury beginning to rise, is a pretty sure sign that it begins to abate. But there are frequently great changes in the air, without any perceptible alteration in the barometer. The alterations of the weight of the air, are generally allowed to be the cause of those in the barometer; but philosophers cannot easily determine whence those alterations rise in the atmosphere. The measuring the heights of mountains, and finding the elevation of places above the level of the sea, hath been much promoted by barometrical experiments, founded upon that essential property of the air, its gravity or pressure. As the column of mercury in the barometer is counterpoised by a column of air of equal weight, so whatever causes make the air heavier or lighter, the pressure of it will be thereby encreased or lessened, and of consequence the mercury will rise or fall.  Again, the air is condensed or expanded, in proportion to the weight or force that presses it. Hence it is, that the higher from the sea, in the midland countries, the mercury descends the lower; because the air becomes more rarified and lighter, and it falls lowest upon the tops of the highest mountains. Harris.  Gravity is another property of air, whereby it counterpoises a column of mercury from twenty-seven inches and one half to thirty and one half, the gravity of the atmosphere varying one tenth, which are its utmost limits; so that the exact specifick gravity of the air cannot be determined when the barometer stands at thirty inches, with a moderate heat of the weather. Arbuthnot on Air.
1072|Baron|2018-02-08 22:35:02 -0500|2018-02-08 22:35:02 -0500|Ba'ron. n.s. [The etymology of this word is very uncertain. Baro, among the Romans, signified a brave warriour, or a brutal man; and, from the first of these significations, Menage derives baron, as a term of military dignity. Others suppose it originally to signify only a man; in which sense baron, or varon, is still used by the Spaniards; and, to confirm this conjecture, our law yet uses baron and femme, husband and wife. Others deduce it from ber, an old Gaulish word, signifying commander; others from the Hebrew נבר, of the same import. Some think it a contraction of par homme, or peer, which seems least probable.]   A degree of nobility next to a viscount. It may be probably thought, that anciently, in England, all those were called barons, that had such signiories as we now call court barons. And it is said, that, after the conquest, all such came to the parliament, and sat as nobles in the upper house. But when, by experience, it appeared, that the parliament was too much crouded with such multitudes, it became a custom, that none should come, but such as the king, for their extraordinary wisdom or quality, thought good to call by writ; which writ ran hac vice tantum. After that, men, seeing that this state of nobility was but casual, and depending merely on the prince's pleasure, obtained of the king letters patent of this dignity to them and their heirs male: and these were called barons by letters patent, or by creation; whose posterity are now those barons that are called lords of the parliament; of which kind the king may create more at his pleasure. It is nevertheless thought, that there are yet barons by writ, as well as barons by letters patent, and that they may be discerned by their titles; the barons by writ being those, that to the title of lord have their own surnames annexed; whereas the barons by letters patent, are named by their baronies. These barons which were first by writ, may now justly also be called barons by prescription; for that they have continued barons, in themselves and their ancestors, beyond the memory of man. There are also barons by tenure, as the bishops of the land, who, by virtue of baronies annexed to their bishopricks, have always had place in the upper house of parliament, and are called lords spiritual.   Baron is an officer, as barons of the exchequer to the king: of these the principal is called lord chief baron, and the three others are his assistants, between the king and his subjects, in causes of justice, belonging to the exchequer.   There are also barons of the cinque ports; two to each of the seven towns, Hastings, Winchelsea, Rye, Rumney, Hithe, Dover, and Sandwich, that have places in the lower house of parliament. Cowel.                              They that bearThe cloth of state above, are four baronsOf the cinque ports. Shakesp. Henry VIII.  Baron is used for the husband in relation to his wife. Cowel.

A barrel of wine is thirty one gallons and a half; of ale, thirty two gallons; of beer, thirty six gallons, and of beer vinegar, thirty four gallons.   In dry measure. A barrel of Essex butter contains one hundred and six pounds; of Suffolk butter, two hundred and fifty six.

[ban, Saxon.]   The solid parts of the body of an animal are made up of hard fibres, tied one to another by small transverse fibres, as those of the muscles. In a fœtus they are porous, soft, and easily discerned. As their pores fill with a substance of their own nature, so they increase, harden, and grow close to one another. They are all spongy, and full of little cells, or are of a considerable firm thickness, with a large cavity, except the teeth; and where they are articulated, they are covered with a thin and strong membrane, called the periosteum. Each bone is much bigger at its extremity than in the middle, that the articulations might be firm, and the bones not easily put out of joint. But, because the middle of the bone should be strong, to sustain its alloted weight, and resist accidents, the fibres are there more closely compacted together, supporting one another; and the bone is made hollow, and consequently not so easily broken, as it must have been, had it been solid and smaller. Quincy.  Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold. Macbeth.  There was lately a young gentleman bit to the bone. Tatler.  A fragment of meat; a bone with as much flesh as adheres to it.

A borough, as I here use it, and as the old laws still use, is not a borough town, that is, a franchised town; but a main pledge of an hundred free persons, therefore called a free borough, or, as you say, francplegium.

1228|Breast (noun)|2018-02-08 22:35:02 -0500|2018-02-08 22:35:02 -0500|Breast. n.s. [bꞃoꞅꞇ, Saxon.]   The middle part of the human body, between the neck and the belly.  The dugs or teats of women which contain the milk. The substance of the breasts is composed of a great number of glands, of an oval figure, which lie in a great quantity of fat.  Their excretory ducts, as they approach the nipples, join and unite together, till at last they form seven, eight, or more, small pipes, called tubuli lactiferi, which have several cross canals, by which they communicate with one another, that if any of them be stopped, the milk, which was brought to it, might not stagnate, but pass through by the other pipes, which all terminate in the extremity of the nipple.  They have arteries and veins from the subclavian and intercostal.  They have nerves from the vertebral pairs, and from the sixth pair of the brain.  Their use is to separate the milk for the nourishment of the fœtus.  The tubes, which compose the glands of the breast in maids, like a sphincter muscle, contract so closely, that no part of the blood can enter them; but when the womb grows big with a fœtus, and compresses the descending trunk of the great artery, the blood flows in a greater quantity, and with a greater force, through the arteries of the breasts, and forces a passage into their glands, which, being at first narrow, admits only a thin water; but growing wider by degrees, as the womb grows bigger, the glands receive a thick serum, and, after birth, they run with a thick milk; because that blood, which before did flow to the fœtus, and, for three or four days afterwards, by the uterus, beginning then to stop, does more dilate the mamillary glands. Quincy. They pluck the fatherless from the breast. Job, xxiv. 9.  The part of a beast that is under the neck, between the fore-legs.   The heart; the conscience; the disposition of the mind.

1260|Cabbage (noun)|2018-02-08 22:35:47 -0500|2018-02-08 22:35:47 -0500|Ca'bbage. n.s. [cabus, Fr. brassica, Lat.] A plant. The leaves are large, fleshy, and of a glaucous colour; the flowers consist of four leaves, which are succeeded by long taper pods, containing several round acrid seeds.  The species are, 1. The common white cabbage. 2. The red cabbage. 3. The Russian cabbage. 4. The flat-sided cabbage. 5. The sugar loaf cabbage. 6. The early Battersea cabbage. 7. The white Savoy cabbage. 8. The green Savoy cabbage. 9. The boorcole. 10. The green broccoli. 11. The Italian broccoli. 12. The turnep-rooted cabbage. 13. The cauliflower. 14. The turnep cabbage. 15. Curled colewort. 16. The musk cabbage. 17. Branching tree cabbage, from the sea coast. 18. Brown broccoli. 19. Common colewort. 20. Perennial Alpine colewort. 21. Perfoliated wild cabbage, with a white flower. 22. Perfoliated cabbage, with a purple flower. The common white, red, flat, and long-sided cabbages, are chiefly cultivated for winter use; the seeds of which must be sown in the middle of March, in beds of good fresh earth.  The Russian cabbage was formerly in much greater esteem than at present, and is rarely brought to the market. The early Battersea and sugar-loaf cabbages, are called Michaelmas cabbages; the season for sowing them is in the middle of July, in an open spot of ground.  The Savoy cabbages are propagated for winter use, as being generally esteemed the better, when pinched by frost.  The boorcole is never eaten till the frost has rendered it tender.  The turnep cabbage was formerly more cultivated in England than at present; and some esteem this kind for soups, but it is generally too strong, and seldom good, except in hard winters.  The curled colewort is more generally esteemed, and is fit for use after Christmas, and continues good until April.  The musk cabbage has, through negligence, been almost lost in England, though, for eating, it is one of the best kinds we have; for it is always looser, and the leaves more crisp and tender, and has a most agreeable musky scent when cut. It will be fit for use in October, November, and December. The branching sea cabbage is found wild in England, and on the sea coast, and is sometimes gathered by the poor inhabitants in the spring, and eaten; but it is apt to be strong and bitter.  The brown broccoli is by many esteemed, though it does not deserve a place in the kitchen garden, where the Roman broccoli can be obtained, which is much sweeter, and will continue longer in season.  The Roman broccoli has large heads, which appear in the center of the plants like clusters of buds.  The heads should be cut before they run up to seed, with about four or five inches of the stems; the skin of these stems should be stripped off, before they are boiled; they will eat very tender, and little inferiour to asparagus.  The common colewort is now almost lost near London, where their markets are usually supplied with cabbage or Savoy plants instead of them; which, being tenderer and more delicate, are better worth cultivating.  The perennial Alpine colewort is also little cultivated at present. The other two sorts of wild cabbage are varieties fit for a botanick garden, but are plants of no use.  The cauliflowers have, of late years, been so far improved in England, as to exceed, in goodness and magnitude, what are produced in most parts of Europe; and, by the skill of the gardners, are continued for several months together; but the most common season for them is in May, June, and July. Miller. Cole, cabbage, and coleworts, which are soft and demulcent, without any acidity; the jelly, or juice, of red cabbage, baked in an oven, and mixed with honey, is an excellent pectoral. Arbuthnot on Aliments.

1262|Cabbage Tree|2018-02-08 22:35:47 -0500|2018-02-08 22:35:47 -0500|Ca'bbage tree. n.s. A species of palm-tree; which see. It is very common in the Caribee islands, where it grows to a prodigious height.  The leaves of this tree envelope each other, so that those which are inclosed, being deprived of the air, are blanched; which is the part the inhabitants cut for plaits for hats, &c. and the genuine, or young shoots, are pickled, and sent into England by the name of cabbage; but whenever this part is cut out, the trees are destroyed; nor do they rise again from the old roots; so that there are very few trees left remaining near plantations, except for ornament; for their stems being exceedingly straight, and their leaves being produced very regularly at top, will afford a most beautiful prospect; for which reason, the planters generally spare two or three of them near their habitations. Miller.

[cacaotal, Span. and therefore more properly written cacao.]  A species of palm-tree, cultivated in most of the inhabited parts of the East and West Indies; but thought a native of the Maldives.  It is one of the most useful trees to the inhabitants of America.  The bark of the nut is made into cordage, and the shell into drinking bowls.  The kernel of the nut affords them a wholesome food, and the milk contained in the shell a cooling liquor.  The leaves of the trees are used for thatching their houses, and are also wrought into baskets, and most other things that are made of osiers in Europe. Miller. The cacao or chocolate nut is a fruit of an oblong figure, much resembling a large olive in size and shape.  It is composed of a thin but hard and woody coat or skin, of a dark blackish colour; and of a dry kernel, filling up its whole cavity, fleshy, dry, firm, and fattish to the touch, of a dusky colour, an agreeable smell, and a pleasant and peculiar taste.  It was uknown to us 'till the discovery of America, where the natives not only drank the liquor made from the nuts, in the manner we do chocolate, but also used them as money.  The tree is not very tall, but grows regularly, and is of a beautiful form, especially when loaded with its fruit.  Its stem is of the thickness of a man's leg, and but a few feet in height; its bark rough, and full of tubercles; and its leaves six or eight inches long, half as much in breadth, and pointed at the ends.  The flowers stand on the branches, and even on the trunk of the tree, in clusters, each having its own pedicle, an inch and sometimes less in length: they are small, of a yellowish colour, and are succeeded by the fruit, which is large and oblong, resembling a cucumber, five, six, or eight inches in length, and three or four in thickness; and, when fully ripe, it is of a purple colour.  Within the cavity of this fruit are lodged the cocoa nuts, usually about thirty in number.  This tree flowers twice or three times in the year, and ripens as many series of fruits. Hill's History of the Mat. Medica.          Amid'those orchards of the sun, Give me to drain the cocoa's milky bowl, And from the palm to draw its freshening wine. Thomson.

[comes stabuli, as it is supposed.]   Lord high constable is an ancient officer of the crown, long disused in England, but lately subsisting in France; where the constable commanded the mareschals, and was the first officer of the army.  The function of the constable of England consisted in the care of the common peace of the land in deeds of arms, and in matters of war.  To the court of the constable and marshal belonged the cognizance of contracts, deeds of arms without the realm, and combats and blasonry of arms within it.  The first constable of England was created by the Conqueror, and the office continued hereditary 'till the thirteenth of Henry VIII. when it was laid aside, as being so powerful as to become troublesome to the king.  From these mighty magistrates are derived the inferiour constables of hundreds and franchises; two of whom were ordained, in the thirteenth of Edward I. to be chosen in every hundred for the conservation of peace, and view of armour.  These are now called high constables, because continuance of time, and increase both of people and offences, have occasioned others in every town of like nature, but inferiour authority, called petty constables.  Besides these, we have constables denominated from particular places; as constable of the Tower, of Dover castle, of the castle of Carnarvon; but these are properly castellani, or governours of castles. Cowel. Chambers. When I came hither, I was lord high constable,And duke of Buckingham; now poor Edward Bohun. Shak. The knave constable had set me i' th' stocks, i' th' common stocks, for a witch.

They are commanded to abstain from all conventicles of men whatsoever; even out of the church, to have nothing to do with publick business. Ayliffe's Parergon.  An assembly for worship.  Generally used in an ill sense, including heresy or schism. It behoveth, that the place where God shall be served by the whole church be a publick place, for the avoiding of privy conventicles, which, covered with pretence of religion, may serve unto dangerous practices.

Shakesp. The man that makes his toe,What he his heart should make,Shall of a corn cry woe,And turn his sleep to wake. Shakespeare's King Lear.

Cowel.

Corrosion is a particular species of dissolution of bodies, either by an acid, or a saline menstruum.  It is almost wholly designed for the resolution of bodies most strongly compacted, as bones and metals; so that the menstruums here employed, have a considerable moment or force.  These liquors, whether acid or urinous, are nothing but salts dissolved in a little phlegm; therefore these being solid, and consequently containing a considerable quantity of matter, do both attract one another more, and are also more attracted by the particles of the body to be dissolved; so when the more solid bodies are put into saline menstruums, the attraction is stronger than in other solutions; and the motion, which is always proportional to the attraction, is more violent: so that we may easily conceive, when the motion is in such a manner increased, it should drive the salts into the pores of the bodies, and open and loosen their cohesion, though ever so firm. Quincy. If there be any medicine that purgeth, and hath neither of the first two manifest qualities, it is to be held suspected as a kind of poison; for that it worketh either by corrosion, or by a secret malignity and enmity to nature.

[cypressius, Latin.] Its leaves are squamose and flat: the male flowers, which are likewise squamose, grow at remote distances from the fruit on the same tree. The fruit is of a spherical form, and is composed of many woody tubercles, in which are contained hard angular seeds. Miller. The cypress is a tall strait tree, produced with great difficulty. Its fruit is of no use: its leaves are bitter, and the very smell and shade of it are dangerous. Hence the Romans looked upon it to be a fatal tree, and made use of it at funerals, and in mournful ceremonies. The wood of the cypress-tree is always green, very heavy, of a good smell, and never either rots or is worm eaten. It is distinguished into male and female: the branches of the male are, as it were, horizontal; and those of the female are upright, which is therefore generally sued for palissades of gardens, and to make pyramids. The fruit is round, of an olive colour, and as large as nuts when they are ripe, and it grows in separate places. The Latins call it conus, because of its figure. This fruit is composed of a kind of scales, in the clefts of which are hidden little seeds, flat and angular. This tree is common on mount Libanus. Calmet.

Fogs, particularly those which we frequently observe after sun-setting, even in our hottest months, are nothing but a vapour, consisting of water, and of such mineral matter as it meets with in its passage and could well bring up along with it; which vapour was sent up in greater quantity all the foregoing day, than now in the evening: but the sun then being above the horizon, taking it at the surface of the earth, and rapidly mounting it up into the atmosphere, it was not discernible, as now it is; because the sun being now gone off, the vapour stagnates at and near the earth, and saturates the air 'till it is so thick as to be easily visible therein: and when at length the heat there is somewhat further spent, which is usually about the middle of the night, it falls down again in a dew, alighting upon herbs and other vegetables, which it cherishes, cools and refreshes, after the scorching heat of the foregoing day.

[diamant, French; adamas, Latin.] The diamond, the most valuable and hardest of all the gems, is, when pure, perfectly clear and pellucid as the purest water; and is eminently distinguished from all other substances by its vivid splendour, and the brightness of its reflexions. It is extremely various in shape and size, being found in the greatest quantity very small, and the larger ones extremely seldom met with. The largest ever known is that in the possession of the great Mogul, which weighs two hundred and seventy-nine carats, and is computed to be worth seven hundred and seventy-nine thousand two hundred and forty-four pounds. The diamond bears the force of the strongest fires, except the concentrated solar rays, without hurt; and even that infinitely fiercest of all fires does it no injury, unless directed to its weaker parts. It bears a glass-house fire for many days, and, if taken carefully out, and suffered to cool by degrees, is found as bright and beautiful as before; but if taken hastily out, it will sometimes crack, and even split into two or three pieces. The places where we have diamonds are the East Indies and the Brasils; and though they are usually found clear and colourless, yet they are sometimes slightly tinged with the colours of the other gems, by the mixture of some metalline particles. Hill on Fossils.  This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart; But keep it 'till you woo another wife. Shakesp. Cymbeline.  Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner; Or, for the diamond, the chain you promised. Shakespeare.  I see how thine eye would emulate the diamond: thou hast the right arched bent of the brow. Shak. Mer. Wives of Winds.  The diamond is preferable and vastly superior to all others in lustre and beauty; as also in hardness, which renders it more durable and lasting, and therefore much more valuable, than any other stone. Woodward's Mett. Foss.  The diamond is by mighty monarchs worn, Fair as the star that ushers in the morn. Blackm. Creation.  The lively diamond drinks thy purest rays, Collected light, compact. Thomson's Summer, l. 140.

Here were the seeds sown of that controversy which sprang up between Beza and Erastus, about the matter of excommunications; whether there ought to be in all churches an eldership, having power to excommunicate, and a part of that eldership to be of necessity certain chosen out from amongst the laity for that purpose. Hooker, Preface.

[electrum, Latin.]   Amber; which, having the quality when warmed by friction of attracting bodies, gave to one species of attraction the name of electricity, and to the bodies that so attract the epithet electrick.   A mixed metal. Change silver plate or vessel into the compound stuff, being a kind of silver electre, and turn the rest into coin. Bacon.

See Electre.]     Attractive without magnetism; attractive by a peculiar property, supposed once to belong chiefly to amber. By electrick bodies do I conceive not such only as take up light bodies, in which number the ancients only placed jett and amber; but such as, conveniently placed, attract all bodies palpable. Brown's Vulgar Errours, b. ii. c. 4. An electrick body can by friction emit an exhalation so subtile, and yet so potent, as by its emission to cause no sensible diminution of the weight of the electrick body, and to be expanded through a sphere, whose diameter is above two feet, and yet to be able to carry up lead, copper, or leaf-gold, at the distance of above a foot from the electrick body. Newton.  Produced by an electrick body. If that attraction were not rather electrical than magnetical, it was wonderous what Helmont delivereth concerning a glass, wherein the magistery of loadstone was prepared, which retained an attractive quality. Brown's Vulgar Errours. If a piece of white paper, or a white cloath, or the end of one's finger, be held at about a quarter of an inch from the glass, the electrick vapour, excited by friction, will, by dashing against the white paper, cloth, or finger, be put into such an agitation as to emit light. Newton's Opt.

See Electre.] A property in some bodies, whereby, when rubbed so as to grow warm, they draw little bits of paper, or such like substances, to them. Quincy. Such was the account given a few years ago of electricity; but the industry of the present age, first excited by the experiments of Gray, has discovered in electricity a multitude of philosophical wonders.  Bodies electrified by a sphere of glass, turned nimbly round, not only emit flame, but may be fitted with such a quantity of the electrical vapour, as, if discharged at once upon a human body, would endanger life.  The force of this vapour has hitherto appeared instantaneous, persons at both ends of a long chain seeming to be struck at once.  The philosophers are now endeavouring to intercept the strokes of lightning.

It is little better than an absurdity, that the cause should be an eleemosynary for its subsistence to its effects, as a nature posteriour to and and dependent on itself. Glanv. Sceps. c. 18.  Given in charity.

If nature should intermit her course, those principal and mother elements of the world, whereof all things in this lower world are made, should lose the qualities which now they have. Hooker, b. i. s. 3.  A man may rationally retain doubts concerning the number of those ingredients of bodies, which some call elements, and other principles. Boyle's Phys. Consider.  Simple substances are either spirits, which have no manner of composition, or the first principles of bodies, usually called elements, of which other bodies are compounded. Watts.  The four elements, usually so called, are earth, fire, air, water, of which our world is composed.  The king is but a man: the violet smells to him as it doth to me; and the element shews to him as it doth to me. Shakes.          My dearest sister, fare thee well; The elements be kind to thee, and make Thy spirits all of comfort. Shakes. Anth. and Cleopatra.                              The king, Contending with the fretful elements, Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea, Or swell the curled waters. Shakespeare's King Lear.

Shakespeare's Henry VIII.  The letters of any language.   The lowest or first rudiments of literature or science.

The genuine elemi is brought from Æthiopia in flattish masses, or in cylinders, of a yellowish colour. Its smell is acrid and resinous.

The spurious or American elemi, almost the only kind known, is of a whitish colour, with a greater or less tinge of a greenish or yellowish. It is of an agreeable smell, and of an acrid and bitterish taste. It proceeds from a tall tree, which the Brasilians wound at night, and in the morning collect the resin that has run out.

[elephas, Latin.]    The largest of all quadrupeds, of whose sagacity, faithfulness, prudence, and even understanding, many surprising relations are given. This animal is not carnivorous, but feeds on hay, herbs, and all sorts of pulse; and it is said to be extremely long lifed. It is naturally very gentle; but when enraged, no creature is more terrible. He is supplied with a trunk, or long hollow cartilage, like a large trumpet, which hangs between his teeth, and serves him for hands: by one blow with his trunk he will kill a camel or a horse, and will raise a prodigious weight with it. His teeth are the ivory so well known in Europe, some of which have been seen as large as a man's thigh, and a fathom in length. Wild elephants are taken with the help of a female ready for the male: she is confined to a narrow place, round which pits are dug; and these being covered with a little earth scattered over hurdles, the male elephants easily fall into the snare. In copulation the female receives the male lying upon her back; and such is his pudicity, that he never covers the female so long as any one appears in sight. Calmet.                  He loves to hear, That unicorns may be betray'd with trees, And bears with glasses, elephants with holes. Sh. Jul. Cæs.  The elephant hath joints, but not for courtesy; His legs are for necessity, not flexure. Sh. Troil. and Cressida.  Ivory; the teeth of elephants.

1834|Escuage|2018-02-08 22:36:54 -0500|2018-02-08 22:36:54 -0500|Escu'age. n.s. [from escu, French, a shield.] Escuage, that is service of the shield, is either uncertain or certain. Escuage uncertain is likewise twofold: first, where the tenant by his tenure is bound to follow his lord, going in person to the king's wars against his enemies, either himself, or to send a sufficient man in his place, at his cost, so many days as were agreed upon between the lord and his first tenant at the granting of the fee; and the days of such service seem to have been rated by the quantity of the land so holden: as, if it extend to a whole knight's fee, then the tenant was bound thus to follow his lord forty days. A knight's fee was so much land as, in those days, was accounted a sufficient living for a knight; and that was six hundred and eighty acres as some think, or eight hundred as others, or 15 l. per Annum. Sir Thomas Smith saith that census equestris is 40 l. revenue in free lands. If the law extend but to half a knight's fee, then the tenant is bound to follow his lord, as above is said, but twenty days. The other kind of this escuage uncertain is called castleward, where the tenant by his land is bound, either by himself or by some other, to defend a castle as often as it shall come to his course. Escuage certain is where the tenant is set at a certain sum of money, to be paid in lieu of such uncertain services: as that a man yearly pay for a knight's fee twenty shillings; for half his fee, ten shillings, or some like rate. Cowel.

Prior.  [From galla.] Galls or galnuts are a kind of preternatural and accidental tumours, produced on various trees; but those of the oak only are used in medicine.  We have two kinds, the Oriental and the European galls: the Oriental are brought from Aleppo, of the bigness of a large nutmeg, with tubercles on their surface, of a very firm and solid texture, and a disagreeable, acerb, and astringent taste.  The European galls are of the same size, with perfectly smooth surfaces: they are light, often spongy, and cavernous within, and always of a lax texture.  They have a less austere taste, and are of much less value than the first sort, both in manufactures and medicine.  The general history of galls is this: an insect of the fly kind, for the safety of her young, wounds the branches of the trees, and in the hole deposites her egg: the lacerated vessels of the tree discharging their contents, form a tumour or woody case about the hole, where the egg is thus defended from all injuries.  This tumour also serves for the food of the tender maggot, produced from the egg of the fly, which, as soon as it is perfect, and in its winged state, gnaws its way out, as appears from the hole found in the gall; and where no hole is seen on its surface, the maggot, or its remains, are sure to be found within, on breaking it.  It has been observed, that the oak does not produce galls in cold countries: but this observation should be confined to the medicinal galls; for all those excrescencies which we find on this tree in our own woods, and call oak-apples, oak-grapes, and oak-cones, are true and genuine galls, though less firm in their texture.  The true reason of the hard ones not being produced with us, seems to be that we want the peculiar species of insect to which they owe their origin, which is a fly of the ichneumon kind, only found in hot countries.  The species of fly that occasions, by its punctures, the soft galls of France and Italy, is different both from the Syrian one and from ours, though still of the ichneumon kind; and we find the several kinds, which occasion the different galls in our own kingdom, produce different kinds, and those of different degrees of hardness, on the same tree.  Galls are used in making ink, and in dying and dressing leather, and many other manufactures.  In medicine they are very astringent, and good under proper management. Hill. Besides the acorns, the oak beareth galls, oak-apples, and oak-nuts. Bacon's Natural History, № 635. Malpighi, in his treatise of galls, under which name he comprehends all preternatural and morbose excrescences, demonstrates that all such excrescences, where any insects are found, are excited by some venenose liquor, which, together with their eggs, such insects shed. Ray on the Creation. The Aleppo galls, wherewith we make ink, are no other than cases of insects, which are bred in them. Derham.

It is called gold in our English tongue either of geel, as Scaliger says, which is in Dutch to shine; or of another Dutch word, which is gelten, and signifies in Latin valere, in English to be of price or value: hence cometh their ordinary word gelt, for money.  Peacham on Drawing.]   Gold is the heaviest, the most dense, the most simple, the most ductile, and most fixed of all bodies; not to be injured either by air or fire, and seeming incorruptible.  It is soluble by means of sea-salt; but is injured by no other salt, and is most easily of all metals amalgamated with silver.  Gold is frequently found native, and very rarely in a state of ore.  It never constitutes a peculiar ore, but is found most frequently among ore of silver.  Native gold is seldom found pure, but has almost constantly silver with it, and very frequently copper.  Gold dust, or native gold, in small masses, is mixed among the sand of rivers in many parts of the world.  It is found, in the greatest abundance, bedded in masses of hard stone, often at the depth of a hundred and fifty fathoms in the mines of Peru.  Pure gold is so fixed, that Boerhaave informs us of an ounce of it set in the eye of a glass furnace for two months, without losing a single grain. Hill on Fossils.

2488|I|2018-02-08 22:38:56 -0500|2018-02-08 22:38:56 -0500|I, Is in English considered both as a vowel and consonant; though, since the vowel and consonant differ in their form as well as sound, they may be more properly accounted two letters. I vowel has a long sound, as fine, thine, which is usually marked by an e final; and a short sound, as fin, thin. Prefixed to e it makes a diphthong of the same sound with the soft i, or double e, ee: thus field, yield, are spoken as feeld, yeeld; except friend, which is spoken frend. Subjoined to a or e it makes them long, as fail, neigh; and to o makes a mingled sound, which approaches more nearly to the true notion of a diphthong, or sound composed of the sounds of two vowels, than any other combination of vowels in the English tongue, as oil, coin.  The sound of i before another i, and at the end of a word, is always expressed by y. J consonant has invariably the same sound with that of g in giant; as jade, jet, jilt, jolt, just.

Locke. All the ideas that are considered as having parts, and are capable of increase by the addition of any equal or less parts, affords us, by their repetition, the idea of infinity. Locke.

Through all the writings of the antient fathers, we see that the words, which were, do continue; the only difference is, that whereas before they had a literal, they now have a metaphorical use, and are as so many notes of remembrance unto us, that what they did signify in the letter, is accomplished in the truth. Hooker, b. iv.  A foundation, being primarily of use in architecture, hath no other literal notation but what belongs to it in relation to an house, or other building, nor figurative, but what is founded in that, and deduced from thence. Hammond.  Following the letter, or exact words.  The fittest for publick audience are such as, following a middle course between the rigour of literal translations and the liberty of paraphrasts, do with greater shortness and plainness deliver the meaning.

Endeavouring to turn his Nisus and Euryalus as close as I was able, I have performed that episode too literally; that giving more scope to Mezentius and Lausus, that version, which has more of the majesty of Virgil, has less of his conciseness. Dryden.  So wild and ungovernable a poet cannot be translated literally; his genius is too strong to bear a chain. Dryden.

2951|Logarithms|2018-02-08 22:39:41 -0500|2018-02-08 22:39:41 -0500|Lógarithms. n.s. [logarithme, Fr. λόγος and ἄριθμος.] Logarithms, which are the indexes of the ratio's of numbers one to another; were first invented by Napier lord Merchison, a Scottish baron, and afterwards completed by Mr. Briggs, Savilian professor at Oxford.  They are a series of artificial numbers, contrived for the expedition of calculation, and proceeding in an arithmetical proportion, as the numbers they answer to do in a geometrical one: for instance,   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512   Where the numbers above, beginning with (0), and arithmetically proportional, are called logarithms.  The addition and subtraction of logarithms answers to the multiplication and division of the numbers they correspond with; and this saves an infinite deal of trouble.  In like manner will the extraction of roots be performed, by dissecting the logarithms of any numbers for the square root, and trisecting them for the cube, and so on. Harris.
2952|Loggats|2018-02-08 22:39:41 -0500|2018-02-08 22:39:41 -0500|Lóggats. n.s. Loggats is the ancient name of a play or game, which is one of the unlawful games enumerated in the thirty-third statute of Henry VIII.  It is the same which is now called kittlepins, in which boys often make use of bones instead of wooden pins, throwing at them with another bone instead of bowling. Hanmer. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but to play at loggats with them. Shakespeare's Hamlet.

All authors to their own defects are blind;Hadst thou but, Janus-like, a face behind,To see the people, when splay mouths they make,To mark their fingers pointed at thy back,Their tongues loll'd out a foot. Dryden's Persius. By Strymon's freezing streams he sat alone,Trees bent their heads to hear him sing his wrongs,Fierce tygers couch'd around, and loll'd their fawning tongues. Dryden's Virgil. By the wolf were laid the martial twins;Intrepid on her swelling dugs they hung,The foster-dam loll'd out her fawning tongue. Dryden.

Perhaps it might be contemptuously derived from lollard, a name of great reproach before the reformation; of whom one tenet was, that all trades not necessary to life are unlawful.]   To lean idly; to rest lazily against any thing. So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so shakes and pulls me. Shakespeare's Othello. He is not lolling on a lewd love bed,But on his knees at meditation. Shakesp. Rich. III.

Dryden.                     A lazy, lolling sortOf ever listless loit'rers. Dunciad, b. iv.  To hang out.  Used of the tongue hanging out in weariness or play. The triple porter of the Stygian seat,With lolling tongue lay fawning at thy feet. Dryden. With harmless play amidst the bowls he pass'd,And with his lolling tongue assay'd the taste. Dryden.

Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love. — It is to be made all of sighs and tears; It is to be made all of faith and service; It is to be all made of fantasy, All made of passion, and all made of wishes; All adoration, duty, and obedience; All humbleness, all patience, all impatience, All purity, all trial, all observance. Shakesp. As you like it.  I could not love I'm sure One who in love were wise. Cowley.  The jealous man wishes himself a kind of deity to the person he loves; he would be the only employment of her thoughts. Addison's Spectator, № 170.  To regard with the affection of a friend.  None but his brethren he, and sisters, knew, Whom the kind youth prefer'd to me, And much above myself I lov'd them too. Cowley.  To regard with parental tenderness.

3032|Manna|2018-02-08 22:40:10 -0500|2018-02-08 22:40:10 -0500|Mánna. n.s. Manna is properly a gum, and is honey-like juice concreted into a solid form, seldom so dry but it adheres more or less to the fingers in handling: its colour is whitish, yellowish, or brownish, and it has in taste the sweetness of sugar, and with it a sharpness that renders it very agreeable: we are supplied with manna from Calabria and Sicily, which is the product of two different trees, but which are of the same genus, being both varieties of the ash: when the heats of summer are free from rain, the leaves, the trunks, and branches of both these trees, exsudate a white honey juice, which concretes into what we call manna, forming itself as it runs, and according to its different quantity, into small roundish drops, or long flakes: what flows out of the leaves of these trees is all natural, but the Italians procure a forced kind by wounding the trunks and branches: the finest manna of all is that which oozes naturally out of the leaves in August, after the season of collecting the common manna is over: the French have another sort of manna, produced from the larch tree, of a very different genus of the ash, and the very tree which produces oil of turpentine; this is called Briançon manna, from the country where it is produced: our black thorn, or sloe tree, sometimes yield a true manna from the ribs of the leaves in Autumn, but it is in a very small quantity: there is another sort called the manna Persia, produced from a small prickly shrub about four or five feet high, growing in Egypt, Armenia, Georgia, and Persia. The Hebrews, who had been acquainted with the last mentioned sort of manna, when they found a miraculous food in the desert resembling it, did not scruple to call it manna: this was a conjecture the more natural to them, as they saw plainly that this descended from the heavens in form of a dew, and concreted into the globules in which they found it; and the received opinion at the time was, that the Oriental manna was formed in the same manner; that it was a dew from the clouds concreted on the plant, none supposing, in those early times, that it was the natural juice of the shrub upon which it was found: it is however evident, that this was not of the nature of manna, because it melted away as the sun grew hot, whereas manna hardens in that heaet. It is but lately that the world was convinced of the mistake of manna being an aërial produce, by an experiment being made by covering a tree with sheets in the manna season, and the finding as much manna on it afterwards as on those which were open to the air and dew.  Manna is celebrated, both by the ancients and moderns, as a gentle and mild cathartick. Hill.  It would be well inquired, whether manna doth fall but upon certain herbs, or leaves only. Bacon's Nat. Hist.  The manna in heaven will suit every man's palate. Locke.

3039|Manor|2018-02-08 22:40:10 -0500|2018-02-08 22:40:10 -0500|Manor. n.s. [manoir, old French; manerium, low Latin; maner, Armorick.] Manor signifies, in common law, a rule or government which a man hath over such as bold land within his fee. Touching the original of these manors, it seems, that, in the beginning, there was a certain compass or circuit of ground granted by the king to some men of worth, for him and his heirs to dwell upon, and to exercise some jurisdiction, more or less, within that compass, as he thought good to grant; performing him such services, and paying such yearly rent for the same, as he by his grant required: and that afterward this great man parcelled his land to other meaner men, injoining them again such services and rents as he thought good; and by that means, as he became tenant to the king, so the inferiours became tenants to him: but those great men, or their posterity, have alienated these mansions and lands so given them by their prince, and many for capital offences have forfeited them to the king; and thereby they still remain in the crown, or are bestowed again upon others. But whosoever possesses these manors, the liberty belonging to them is real and predial, and therefore remains, though the owners be changed. In these days, a manor rather signifies the jurisdiction and royalty incorporeal, than the land or site: for a man may have a manor in gross, as the law terms it, that is, the right and interest of a court-baron, with the perquisites thereto belonging. Cowel.  My parks, my walks, my manors that I had, Ev'n now forsake me; and of all my lands Is nothing left me. Shakespeare's Henry VI.                          Kinsmen of mine, By this so sicken'd their estates, that never They shall abound as formerly. O many Have broke their backs with laying manors on them For this great journey.  Shakespeare's Rich. II.

The milky-way, or via lactea, is a broad white path or track, encompassing the whole heavens, and extending itself in some places with a double path, but for the most part with a single one. Some of the ancients, as Aristotle, imagined that this path consisted only of a certain exhalation hanging in the air; but, by the telescopical observations of this age, it hath been discovered to consist of an innumerable quantity of fixed stars, different in situation and magnitude, from the confused mixture of whose light its whole colour is supposed to be occasioned. It passes through the constellations of Cassiopeia, Cygnus, Aquila, Perseus, Andromeda, part of Ophiucus and Gemini, in the northern hemisphere; and in the southern it takes in part of Scorpio, Sagittarius, Centaurus, the Argo Navis and the Ara. The galaxy hath usually been the region in which new stars have appeared; as that in Cassiopeia, which was seen in A. D. 1572; that in the breast of the Swan, and another in the knee of Serpentarius; which have appeared for a while, and then become invisible again.

[mumie, Fr. mumia, Lat. derived by Salmasius from amomum, by Bochart from the Arabick.]   A dead body preserved by the Egyptian art of embalming.  We have two different substances preserved for medicinal use under the name of mummy: one is the dried flesh of human bodies embalmed with myrrh and spice; the other is the liquor running from such mummies when newly prepared, or when affected by great heat, or by damps: this is sometimes of a liquid, sometimes of a solid form, as it is preserved in vials well stopped, or suffered to dry and harden in the air: the first kind is brought to us in large pieces, of a lax and friable texture, light and spungy, of a blackish brown colour, and often black and clammy on the surface; it is of a strong but not agreeable smell: the second sort, in its liquid state, is a thick, opake, and viscous fluid, of a blackish and a strong, but not disagreeable smell: in its indurated slate it is a dry, solid substance, of a fine shining black colour and close texture, easily broken, and of a good smell: this sort is extremely dear, and the first sort so cheap, that as all kinds of mummy are brought from Egypt we are not to imagine it to be the ancient Egyptian mummy. What our druggists are supplied with is the flesh of executed criminals, or of any other bodies the Jews can get, who fill them with the common bitumen so plentiful in that part of the world. and adding aloes, and some other cheap ingredients, send them to be baked in an oven till the juices are exhaled, and the embalming matter has penetrated so thoroughly that the flesh will keep. Mummy has been esteemed resolvent and balsamick; and besides it, the skull, and even the moss growing on the skulls of human skeletons, have been celebrated for antiepileptick virtues; the fat also of the human body has been recommended in rheumatisms, and every other part or humour have been in repute for the cure of some disease: at present we are wise enough to know, that the virtues ascribed to the parts of the human body are all either imaginary, or such as may be found in other animal substances: the mummy and the skull alone of all these horrid medicines retain their places in the shops. Hill's Mat. Med.   The silk Was dy'd in mummy, which the skilful Conserv'd of maidens hearts. Shakesp. Othello.  It is strange how long carcases have continued uncorrupt, as appeareth in the mummies of Egypt, having lasted some of them three thousand years. Bacon's Nat. Hist. № 771.

This tree is carefully cultivated.  But that which produces the male nutmeg grows wild in the mountainous parts of the Moluccas.  Nutmeg is much used in our foods, and is of excellent virtues as a medicine.  Hill.

Locke.  No leases shall ever be made other than leases for years not exceeding thirty-one, in possession, and not in reversion or remainder. Swift.

A practice has long prevailed among writers, to use owing, the active participle of owe, in a passive sense, for owed or due.  Of this impropriety Bolinbroke was aware, and, having no quick sense of the force of English words, has used due, in the sense of consequence or imputation, which by other writers is only used of debt.  We say, the money is due to me; Bolinbroke says, the effect is due to the cause.   Consequential.  This was owing to an indifference to the pleasures of life, and an aversion to the pomps of it.

4546|Water (noun)|2018-02-08 22:44:04 -0500|2018-02-08 22:44:04 -0500|Wa'ter. n.s. [waeter, Dutch; ƿœꞇꞃ, Saxon.]   Sir Isaac Newton defines water, when pure, to be a very fluid salt, volatile, and void of all savour or taste; and it seems to consist of small, smooth, hard, porous, spherical particles, of equal diameters, and of equal specifick gravities, as Dr. Cheyne observes; and also that there are between them spaces so large, and ranged in such a manner, as to be pervious on all sides. Their smoothness accounts for their sliding easily over one another's surfaces: their sphericity keeps them also from  touching one another in more points than one; and by both these their frictions in sliding over one another, is rendered the least possible. Their hardness accounts for the incompressibility of water, when it is free from the intermixture of air. The porosity of water is so very great, that there is at least forty times as much space as matter in it; for water is nineteen times specifically lighter than gold, and consequently rarer in the same proportion.
