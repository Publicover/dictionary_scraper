When the gall-pipe, or the roots rather of the common ducts of that pipe, are any wise stopped up, that matter which should be turned into gall is taken up by the vein, and carried back again into the mass of blood, and tinctures it yellow; so that the eyes, inside of the lips, slaver, and all the parts of the horse, that are capable of shewing the colour, appear yellow.

He that has a spaniel by his side is a yeoman of about one hundred pounds a year, an honest man: he is just qualified to kill an hare. Addison.
